## The journey so far

Currently I have am coming up on my 6th year of programming in python. I first started in my pre-GCSE computer science classes, then throughout GCSE learned to use conditional syntax and similar concepts in a procedural programming paradigm. Next I progressed onto A-Levels where I continued to use python for my course during which I learnt how to program in an object oriented paradigm aswell as learning about increasignly more complex algorithms. This was to help build up our programming ability for the final coding project at the end of college, now most recently I have had to use python - amongst other languages - in my first year modules at the university of nottingham.


## Problem Solver
Ever since I was young I've enjoyed solving problems around me, this first began with lego and building objects such as cars to try and get down stairs without breaking or crashing, slowly this evolved into a passion for solving problems through code, ranging from solving small leetcode problems to creating algorithms that simulate plasmodial protist organisms and training neural networks to predict and then purchase stocks based off of a range of indicators.


## Beyond Programming

Outside of computer science I've been in scouting for over a decade, progressing from the yougest section in scouts - beavers - all the way through the system to now be a young leader heading to slovenia in July/August 2025. Over the years scouting has provided me with opportunites such as getting my Gold Duke of Edinburgh award and going to the 25th world scout jamboree in Saemangeum, South Korea. Furthermore I have a strong passion for mountain biking and climbing both of which have taken me abroad to places such as Morzine (France) and El Chorro (Spain) respectively.
