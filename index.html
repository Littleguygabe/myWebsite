            <p>A passionate Python programmer with a newfound interest in web development. I love creating clean and efficient solutions to complex problems.</p>

                    <h3>Education</h3>
                    <div class="experience-details">
                        <p>
                            Most recently I finished my 1st year of my degree during which I took the opportunity to join as many societies as possible
                            (such as Economics and Finance, Computer Science, Financial Technologies and Climbing to name a few). During this year I covered a wide range of topics across all of my modules from low level system architecture
                            to <b>Natural Language Processing</b>, this allowed me to explore more aspects of computer science and hence solidify my interest in <b>Artificial Intelligence</b> and <b>Financial Algorithms</b>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Previous to university I completed my A-Levels at Burnley College where I achieved the following results:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Mathematics - A</li>
                                <li>Computer Science - A</li>
                                <li>Economics - B</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="experience-card">
                    <h3>Interests</h3>
                    <div class="experience-details">
                        <p>Aside from AI and programming I have a fairly wide range of interests but mostly centered around being active. One of my main interests is <b>Climbing</b>, this includes bouldering (so short routes with no ropes) aswell as 
                            lead climbing (climbing with ropes and clipping the rope in as you go). With the <b>University of Nottingham</b> being an especially 'sporty' university the climbing club is well equipped for all sorts of climbing.
                            So this varies from weekly meet-ups at the local gym to internation climbing trips (most recently <b>El Chorro</b> in Spain)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Furthermore I have a strong passion for <b>Mountain Biking</b> whether that being riding local trails or making trips to places such as <b>Andorra</b> & <b>Morzine</b> to use the ski-uplifts that are adapted
                            take bikes during the summer season
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My interest in <b>Mountain Biking</b> extends beyond just riding bikes and into the technical side of the sport, looking at the new prototype components being produced by elite racing teams and how they
                            can provide marginal gains to that team when racing
                        </p>

                    <div class="experience-details">
                        <p>Currently I have been involved in the Scouting Association for over a <b>decade</b> first joining as a 'Beaver' when I was younger and now I've progressed up through the system to become a <b>Young Scout Leader</b>.
                        Throughout my years in scouting I have been presented with some incredible opportunities such as the <b>2023 World Scout Jamboree</b> </p>
