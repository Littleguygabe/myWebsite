        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>A passionate Python programmer with a newfound interest in web development. I love creating clean and efficient solutions to complex problems.</p>

            <h3>The Journey So Far</h3>
            <p>Currently, I am coming up on my <b>6th year of programming in Python</b>. I first started in my pre-GCSE computer science classes, then throughout GCSE learned to use <b>conditional syntax</b> and similar concepts in a <b>procedural programming paradigm</b>. Next, I progressed onto A-Levels where I continued to use Python for my course, during which I learned how to program in an <b>object-oriented paradigm</b> as well as learning about increasingly more complex algorithms. This was to help build up our programming ability for the final coding project at the end of college. Most recently, I have had to use Python—amongst other languages—in my first-year modules at the <b>University of Nottingham</b>.</p>

            <h3>Problem Solver</h3>
            <p>Ever since I was young, I've enjoyed <b>solving problems</b> around me. This first began with Lego and building objects such as cars to try and get down stairs without breaking or crashing. Slowly, this evolved into a passion for solving problems through code, ranging from solving small LeetCode problems to creating algorithms that <b>simulate plasmodial protist organisms</b> and training neural networks to <b>predict and then purchase stocks</b> based off of a range of indicators.</p>

            <h3>Beyond Programming</h3>
            <p>Outside of computer science, I've been in <b>Scouting for over a decade</b>, progressing from the youngest section in scouts—Beavers—all the way through the system to now be a <b>Young Leader</b> heading to Slovenia in July/August 2025. Over the years, Scouting has provided me with opportunities such as getting my <b>Gold Duke of Edinburgh award</b> and going to the <b>25th World Scout Jamboree</b> in Saemangeum, South Korea. Furthermore, I have a strong passion for <b>mountain biking and climbing</b>, both of which have taken me abroad to places such as Morzine (France) and El Chorro (Spain) respectively.</p>
